              Greetings! I'm Ujjwal, and I extend a warm welcome to my website.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a seasoned data scientist with over 10 years of professional experience, I've delved into projects
              encompassing big data analytics, predictive modeling, machine learning, deep learning, and natural
              language
              processing. I completed my education at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur in 2013. During
              my
              leisure time, I enjoy participating in Kaggle competitions.
            </p>

            I am a member of the Map Observables team, tasked with constructing Self-Driving Maps for BMW's Urban Cruise

          <ul>
            <li>
              Tackling global-scale challenges by harnessing petabytes of data for creating high-definition maps in the
              field of autonomous driving. I have successfully enhanced crucial performance indicators such as False
              Positives, False Negatives, and Accuracy by more than 50% when compared to traditional legacy systems.
            </li>
            <li>
              Applying machine learning algorithms and XGBoost models to integrate data observations from diverse input
              sources, including dashcams and overhead imagery. This process allows to deduce the accurate location and
              attributes of road signs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Crafting innovative graph-based solutions to counteract positional observation drift from drive-based data
              sources used in map content. This implementation resulted in a notable reduction of False Positives by
              around 5%, surpassing the performance of radial search-based clustering.

            <li>
              Constructing a question-answering engine using LLAMA over extensive product and data requirement documents
              for data validations. This tool empowers users to efficiently search through these documents, extracting

            I was a member of the Care Tech team, where I leverage machine learning, deep learning, and natural language
            processing techniques to extract insights and facilitate automation. This involved analyzing customer
            service interactions across diverse channels such as email, in-app requests, chat, Twitter, and more. My
            work involved:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Facilitating AI/ML-driven intent detection through the implementation of multilingual NLP models. I
              developed intent classification models based on XLM-RoBERTa to support various languages, including Bahasa
              and English, achieving an accuracy rate exceeding 80%. Additionally, I deployed these models into
              production using torchscript and MLFlow.
            </li>
            <li>
              Constructing named entity recognition (NER) models based on IndoBERT, utilizing open-source IndoNLU
              datasets. These models were designed to identify entities such as food, quantity, date, and chit-chat
              within text utterances.
            </li>
            <li>
              Enhancing the search experience for help center articles by incorporating tags to encompass semantic
              diversity in search queries. I implemented a TF-IDF and Logistic Regression pipeline to extract pertinent
              keywords for each article, contributing to an improved search functionality.
            </li>
            <li>
              Establishing a pipeline for issue discovery to identify emerging themes in service tickets and app
              reviews. Utilizing PyLDAVis and BERTopic libraries, I implemented topic modeling. Additionally, I trained
              sentence transformer models using SetFit for better results.

              I was part of the data science team working on Natural Language Understanding (NLU) layer of the AskAmex
              chatbot. My work involved:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Training transformer-based models (like BERT, distilBERT, RoBERTa etc.) for intent classification. I
                removed label noise from training datasets using various robust machine learning techniques which lead
                to
                5% increase in prediction accuracy.
              </li>
              <li>
                Building human-in-the-loop (HITL) pipelines for collecting labeled data at a minimal cost. I used weak
                supervision and active learning strategies to filter relevant data points for annotation. I built
                various
                interactive tools to help data labelers work efficiently. I introduced best practices and quality checks
                in the annotation pipelines to ensure high-quality output.
              </li>
              <li>
                Collaborating with product teams to improve customer experience. I built interactive tools to visualize
                the performance of servicing journeys. These tools helped identify the edge cases that often lead to
                automation failures. I introduced tracking around sentiment level KPIs (apart from automation) to
                holistically capture the channel performance.

              <li>
                Building factorization machine models to predict click-through rate. I built spark-based feature
                engineering pipelines to process terabytes of clickstream data for training these models. The models
                were
                part of the final stacked ensemble that got deployed in production.

              <li>
                Optimizing impression caps on offers to drive higher overall engagement on the channel. I built xgboost
                models to analyse the sensitivity of click-through rate with respect to impressions. I used the partial
                dependency plots from these models to identify the impression cap that maximised f-beta score.

                Building artificial neural network-based models. These were binary classification models which predicted
                the probability of an existing customer taking up a more premium product. These models replaced the
                legacy
                logistic regression models by delivering better performance while simultaneously driving operational
                efficiency.

                Migrating the legacy data transformation and feature engineering pipelines from sas to python to support
                the deployment of above mentioned neural network models in production. Enabled automated re-training

                Targeting strategy for dynamic email campaigns in partnership with movable ink. The focus was to
                increase
                customer spending on small merchants in the UK. I analyzed transaction data to understand the location
                and
                category preferences of the customers. The analysis generated content-based recommendations displayed to
                the customer via dynamic emails. The open and click rates for these campaigns were significantly higher
                than the long term average.

              <li>
                Supporting a joint venture with Gurunavi. Amex partnered with Gurunavi to offer dining recommendations
                to
                customers in Japan. I designed customer segments by clustering spending patterns across various industry
                verticals. The customer segments mapped to different personas, each of which received an exclusive set
                of
                restaurant recommendations.
